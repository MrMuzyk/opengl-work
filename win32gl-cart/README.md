Win32 OpenGL Cart
===================

An OpenGL and Win32 API based program to present a cart which consists of a cube and 4 wheels(one of them is special for testing).

Usage
-----------------

* Move mouse: rotate the cart
* Left mouse drag: move the cart around
* Scroll: accelerate the cart to move futher or closer
 

Build
-----------------

For the time being, we only provides Makefile for MinGW under Windows, but it's easy to port it to other compilers under Windows.

* Under MSYS, `make`

Development Status
-------------------

These codes are written years ago, not well organized but could be fun to play with.
